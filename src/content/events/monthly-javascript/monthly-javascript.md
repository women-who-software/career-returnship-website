In this session, we’ll cover what Firebase is and how you can use it to quickly set up new React projects. We’ll go over each of Firebase’s most useful tools at a high level (did you say built-in database and domain hosting?), and will show you how you can create a secure, scalable platform that can handle 1 user or millions of users without any large code changes.
